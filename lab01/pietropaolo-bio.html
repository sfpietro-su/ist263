        Hi! My name is Sofia Pietropaolo. I am a part of the iSchool 
        with a major in innovation, society, and technology. I love 
        computer science and I’m interested in learning about AI and 
        how it affects society. I can code in c++, python, and SQL. 
        I also love all things music. I play the guitar and the piano 
        and I love to sing. I’m not a big reader but my all-time favorite 
        book is The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and My favorite show 
        is New Girl. I have an older brother named Zack, a dog named 
        Hunter and 2 chinchillas named Cocoa and Lenny.
