            <p> Hi! My name is <span class="name"> Sofia Pietropaolo.</span> I am a part of the iSchool with a major in innovation, society, and technology. I love computer science and I’m interested in learning about AI and how it affects society. I can code in c++, python, and SQL. I also love all things music. I play the guitar and the piano and I love to sing. I’m not a big reader but my all-time favorite book is The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and My favorite show is New Girl. I have an older brother named Zack, a dog named Hunter and 2 chinchillas named Cocoa and Lenny.</p>
