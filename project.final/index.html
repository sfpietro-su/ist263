            <p>Hi! My name is Sofia Pietropaolo. I am a 19-year-old student at Syracuse University. The summer before my freshman year, I was diagnosed with celiac disease. Although this came as quite a shock, it was a fairly easy transition as I already had a lot of experience with gluten free eating as well as cooking. This is my grandmother, Sandra Peavey. She has been gluten free for 15 years. When I was younger, she and my grandfather would watch my brother and me on Monday nights. Every week she would teach me a new gluten free recipe. My favorite part of the week was cooking with her. Now I get to share our love of gluten free cooking with others. Whether youâ€™ve been celiac your whole life or are just thinking about being gluten free this is the right place for you</p>
