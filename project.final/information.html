        <h1>More Celiac Information</h1>
        <p>Most people think being gluten free is just a choice for healthier eating. While for some it is, did you know untreated celiac disease can lead type-1 diabetes, epilepsy, cancer and even death? It is a very treatable and easily managed disease if people are educated and aware of it</p>
        <p>Gluten sensitivity and celiac disease are two distinct conditions related to the consumption of gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. While they share some similarities, they differ in their nature, severity, and diagnostic criteria.</p>  
        <p>Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the ingestion of gluten leads to damage in the small intestine. The immune system mistakenly attacks the small intestine in response to gluten, leading to inflammation and damage to the lining of the intestine. Gluten sensitivity is a condition in which individuals experience symptoms similar to those of celiac disease after consuming gluten, but without the autoimmune response and damage to the small intestine seen in celiac disease.</p>
        <p>Celiac disease is considered a more severe condition than gluten sensitivity. If left untreated, it can lead to long-term complications, including malabsorption of nutrients, anemia, osteoporosis, and other autoimmune disorders. While gluten sensitivity can cause discomfort and various symptoms, it is generally considered less severe than celiac disease. It does not lead to the same long-term complications.</p>
        <p>Diagnosis of Celiac disease often involves blood tests to detect specific and confirmation through a small intestinal biopsy. A strict gluten-free diet is the primary treatment, and symptoms usually improve upon its implementation. Diagnosing gluten sensitivity can be challenging because there are no specific blood markers or intestinal damage associated with the condition. Diagnosis is often made by excluding celiac disease and wheat allergy and observing symptom improvement on a gluten-free diet.</p>
        <p>For individuals with celiac disease, consuming even small amounts of gluten can trigger an immune response that damages the lining of the small intestine. This damage can lead to various symptoms and, over time, result in serious health complications. Here's what happens when someone with celiac disease ingests gluten:  the immune system mistakenly identifies gluten as a threat and produces antibodies. These antibodies attack the tissues of the small intestine. The immune response causes inflammation in the small intestine, damaging the villiâ€”small, finger-like projections that line the intestinal wall. Villous atrophy, or the flattening of these villi, reduces the surface area available for nutrient absorption. The damage to the intestine can lead to a range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, and nutrient deficiencies. However, it's important to note that some individuals with celiac disease may not experience noticeable symptoms despite ongoing intestinal damage.</p> 
        <p>If left untreated, celiac disease can lead to long-term complications such as malabsorption of nutrients, anemia, osteoporosis, infertility, neurological disorders, and an increased risk of other autoimmune diseases and certain cancers. It's crucial for individuals with celiac disease to strictly adhere to a gluten-free diet. Even small amounts of gluten, such as crumbs or cross-contamination, can trigger an immune response and perpetuate intestinal damage. Managing celiac disease involves not only avoiding gluten-containing foods but also being vigilant about cross-contamination in food preparation, utensils, and shared kitchen spaces.</p>
